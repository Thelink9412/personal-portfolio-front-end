                <p>
                    "Ammuccamu!" is a food delivery application specifically designed to operate within the city of Catania. 
                    The platform focuses on local culinary traditions, allowing users to order territorial specialties such as 
                    typical sweets, fresh fish from the "Pescheria," and Catania's signature horse meat. 
                    To meet the needs of all parties involved, the app features three distinct navigation flows: 
                    one for customers, one for riders, and one for restaurateurs.

                <h4>Structure</h4>
                <p>
                    The structural phase was essential for defining the application's information architecture, 
                    distinguishing three primary flows for users, riders, and restaurant owners. 
                    Each flow was designed with unique sections and functionalities to ensure an optimized experience 
                    for every type of stakeholder involved.
